The Fink Brazil workshop took place at CBPF, Rio de Janeiro, from 6 to 10 June 2024. This event bring together researchers interested in exploring the potential applications of Fink data, both in the context of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), as well as the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory Large Survey of Space and Time (LSST). 

The program includes keynote speakers and contributed talks, posters and tutorials that will help prepare the local community for the arrival of LSST data, maximizing the scientific output of the alert stream. All presentations are available [online](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/31068/). We also had several round tables to build stronger connections between domain experts, machine learning specialists, observational facilities and the Fink community. Thanks all participants for the very fruitful workshop!

This event is supported by FAPERJ and CNRS-IN2P3.
