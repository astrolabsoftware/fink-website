Our first Australian workshop was held in Melbourne between the 3 and 5th of May 2023. We had over 50
simultaneous participants both in person and online. It was a great moment to share current facilities, research and start
setting the bases for Rubin LSST first light!

We had a very dynamic schedule with talks about Rubin, Australia LSST involvement, facilities at all
wavelengths both in Australia and New Zealand, high-energy, radio, optical, gravitational wave transients, variables, potential
theoretical observations, services in Australia, discussion sessions, and much more! Full program

We are grateful for the final remarks by Swinburne's VC Pascale Quester and the attendance of the CNRS Oceania
representative Thierry Correge. We also thank [https://www.ozgrav.org](ARC CoE OzGrav), the
[https://www.afran.org.au](Australian-French Association for Research and Innovation (AFRAN)) and CNRS IN2P3 for your support to make the event a success!

It is now to start the momentum towards several amazing ideas and potential collaborations from this workshop.
Thanks for a productive time in Oceania!
