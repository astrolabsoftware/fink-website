You are looking for a nice outreach project using Fink data? Check out the Fink watch! It displays the number of alerts per night processed by the astronomical broker [Fink](https://fink-broker.org) in real-time. The watch uses a Raspberry Pi to control the LCD Display Module, and it polls alert information from the Fink Kafka cluster.
