      <description>We had our first in-person Collaboration Meeting last month in Annecy. This was 3 years after the start of the project, which included 2 years of pandemic. It was a pleasure to host and work with so many scientists!
The two days were super active, with a lot of discussions and hands-on tutorials. We were super happy to see all the new developments, and such a diversity in the science topics.</description>

      <title>Solar System Science with Fink</title>
      <link>https://fink-broker.org/2022-01-28-sso-science/</link>

      <description>Linking alerts to known moving objects Each night, Fink receives alerts from the public survey of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The alert stream primarily includes events from flux transients and variables, but it also contains a large fraction of Solar System objects (SSO). Alert candidates are typically linked to an object on the sky by a cone search at the position of the alert. While this allows us to easily retrieve the brightness variation of a static object on the sky over time, this does not work if one wants to study a moving object.</description>

      <title>Interface changes</title>
      <link>https://fink-broker.org/2022-01-18-what-changed/</link>

      <description>API changes With the recent maintenance, we did a number of changes to sanitize the infrastructure and the pipelines. Some of these changes breaks the compatibility with older Fink versions. All changes apply from fink-broker version 1.4+ and fink-science version 0.5+, with a new schema.
Active Learning module We introduced a name change for the output of the module. The old rfscore field is now replaced by rf_snia_vs_nonia. The module itself did not change, and the values remain the same.</description>

      <title>Power failures at the University</title>
      <link>https://fink-broker.org/2022-01-18-power-failure/</link>

      <guid>https://fink-broker.org/2022-01-18-power-failure/</guid>
      <description>Work has been done! This year, we had regular power outages at the VirtualData center, mainly due to a weak and old electrical network at the University. The IT teams at IJCLab regularly restarted all machines and services in a short amount of time after hard cuts (included evenings and week-ends!), and we designed more and more robust and automatic systems to keep the whole infrastructure healthy and operative after going completely crazy.</description>

      <description>Storage system failure The last reboot of machines (14/12) had revealed a serious problem in our storage system. Long story short, a large part of Fink data could not be recovered, making difficult to get some services back online, and we had no backup for this. It is yet unclear what happened exactly, but most likely a manipulation of the journal of transations in November that silently corrupted the system, only revealed a month later when the systems were rebooted.</description>

      <title>Infrastructures in Fink</title>

      <description>Fink infrastructure Let&amp;rsquo;s take the opportunity of the bad turn of recent events to talk and learn a bit more on the infrastructure in place for Fink.
Fink is deployed on the cloud, that is each box in the Figure is an independent set of machines where specific software are running and executing tasks.
Nightly alert processing The central part of the processing in Fink is the Apache Spark cluster (see fink-broker).</description>

      <description>Check out the new page about Fink processed data statistics on the Science Portal: heatmap, daily statistics, timelines, and more! These statistics are updated once a day, after the ZTF observing night.
The header tells you about the last night we had data, the number of processed alerts for this night, the total number of processed alerts since 2019/11/01, as well as how many got a label by Fink.
Heatmap The Heatmap tab shows the number of alerts processed by Fink for each night since the beginning of our operations (2019/11/01).</description>

      <title>LSST enabling science 2020 broker workshop</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to enable new science with the LSST alert stream, brokers are developing a new layer in the time domain ecosystem, experimenting with new ways of enriching and filtering these data. A diversity of solutions are being tested, but there is a need for more interaction between brokers, their community of users, and the alert generation teams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Fink decided to participate to the LSST call for community broker. The first step was the submission of a Letter of Intent to LSST in Summer 2019 to describe the project, and our goals: &lt;em&gt;Fink - a new generation of astronomy broker based on Active Learning and Apache Spark.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
