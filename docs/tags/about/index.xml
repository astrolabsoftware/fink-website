      <description>Fink is a community driven project, open to anyone, that processes time-domains alert streams and connects them with follow-up facilities and science teams. Fink broker has been selected as a community broker to process the full stream of transient alerts from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Since 2020, we are processing the alert stream from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).
Fink&amp;rsquo;s processed data stream from ZTF can be accessed through our science portal and our API (with tutorials).</description>
