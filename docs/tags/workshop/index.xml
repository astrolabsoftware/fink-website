      <description>Our first Australian workshop was held in Melbourne between the 3 and 5th of May 2023. We had over 50 simultaneous participants both in person and online. It was a great moment to share current facilities, research and start setting the bases for Rubin LSST first light!
We had a very dynamic schedule with talks about Rubin, Australia LSST involvement, facilities at all wavelengths both in Australia and New Zealand, high-energy, radio, optical, gravitational wave transients, variables, potential theoretical observations, services in Australia, discussion sessions, and much more!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to enable new science with the LSST alert stream, brokers are developing a new layer in the time domain ecosystem, experimenting with new ways of enriching and filtering these data. A diversity of solutions are being tested, but there is a need for more interaction between brokers, their community of users, and the alert generation teams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
